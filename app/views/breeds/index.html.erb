    <p>Dogs possess an astonishingly diverse range of breeds, with over 340 recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. Each breed showcases unique characteristics, from the towering Great Dane to the diminutive Chihuahua. This diversity arises from centuries of selective breeding, with humans shaping dogs to excel in various roles, such as hunting, herding, guarding, and companionship. Despite their varied appearances and temperaments, all dogs belong to the same species, Canis lupus familiaris, and share a common ancestor with wolves. This rich tapestry of breeds highlights the adaptability and versatility of dogs, making them one of the most remarkable creatures on Earth.</p>
